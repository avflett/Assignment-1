## Purpose of the following Commands:

- `mkdir`: Creates a directory.
- `cd`: Change directories.
- `code`: Opens Visual Studio Code.
- `ls`: Lets us view files in a directory.

## Why Version Control is Important

With version control, it is possible to:

- Create branches that allows multiple individuals to develop and test versions of the main project which is then merged back into the main branch.
- Rectify any conflicts that may occur upon merging different branches to the main branch.
- Users can add annotations on changes they have made explaning why they made that change.
- Decide which user is authorized to make changes in each part of the project.

## Purpose of the following Git Commands

- `git init`: Enables Git Bash to create repository within file location.
- `git status`: Gives users an update on current events on Git. 
- `git add`: Adds updated files to repository.
- `git commit`: Creates milestones throughout the Git project.
- `git push`: Uploads changes made in local repository to a remote repository. 
- `git pull`: Pulls changes from remote repository to local repository.
- `git log`: Displays the history of all the commits within a Git repository.
- `git branch`: Duplicates the code of the main branch which allows multiple users to work simultaneously on that same code.
- `git merge`: Merges the changes made from all the branches to the main branch, or to another branch. 
- `git checkout`: Allows users to switch between the different branches.
