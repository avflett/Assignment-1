## Purpose of the following Commands:

- `mkdir`: Creates a directory.
- `cd`: Change directories.
- `code`: Opens Visual Studio Code.
- `ls`: Lets us view files in a directory.

## Why Version Control is Important

With version control, it is possible to:

- Create branches that allows multiple individuals to develop and test versions of the main project which is then merged back into the main branch.
- Rectify any conflicts that may occur upon merging different branches to the main branch.
- Users can add annotations on changes they have made explaning why they made that change.
- Decide which user is authorized to make changes in each part of the project.
